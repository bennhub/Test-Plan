## Introduction 
This document outlines the testing approach and methodology for the website under consideration. It includes details about testing resources, scope, schedule, and risks associated with the testing process.

## Testing Resources
- **Testerâ€™s Name and Role:** [Tester's Name], QA Engineer

## Scope of Testing
- **In Scope:** 
   - Homepage
   - Login functionality
   - Registration functionality
   - Product pages
   - Checkout process
   - Contact form
   
- **Out of Scope:** 
   - Admin functionalities

## Testing Approaches
- **Testing Approach and Methodology:** The testing will follow a combination of manual and automated testing approaches. Manual testing will be used for exploratory testing, while automated testing will be employed for regression testing and continuous integration. 

- **Types of Testing to Be Performed:** 
   - Functional testing
   - Usability testing
   - Compatibility testing (across different browsers and devices)
   - Performance testing (response time, load testing)
   - Security testing (input validation, authentication, authorization) 
  
## Automation Priorities
   - Discuss with the Client: Meet with the client to identify high-traffic areas, areas prone to breakage, and areas with the most business value for automation.
   - Identify Automation Targets: Determine the modules or functionalities that would benefit most from automation based on client input and testing team analysis.

## Test Schedule
- **Timeline for Each Testing Phase:**
   - Functional testing: Week 1-2
   - Usability testing: Week 3
   - Compatibility testing: Week 4
   - Performance testing: Week 5
   - Security testing: Week 6

## Risks & Issues
- **Risks Associated with the Testing Process:**
   - Lack of testing environment availability
   - Limited test coverage due to time constraints
   - Compatibility issues across different browsers and devices
   
- **Mitigation Strategies for Identified Risks:**
   - Regular communication with the development team to ensure availability of testing environment
